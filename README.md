# Lyric-Analysis-and-Music-Genre-Classification-Using-NLP-in-R
Performed Lyric Analysis of Prince's discography and Music genre classification using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm for topic modelling.


### Description
**Lyric analysis of prince**: The goal of this is to use text mining and Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to shed insight on the Artistâ€™s career. The dataset used was obtained from Billboard chart information and Prince lyrics from various websites. 

**Music Genre Classification**:Topic modelling is technique of text mining to automatically identify topics present in a text object and to derive hidden patterns exhibited by a text corpus. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is the most popular topic modeling technique. The dataset is a collection of 380,000 lyrics from songs scraped from metrolyrics.com

### Software Used
R, Jupyter notebook

### Libraries Used
dplyr, ggplot2, tidytext, topicmodels (LDA algorithm), tm (document-term-matrix)

### Results
