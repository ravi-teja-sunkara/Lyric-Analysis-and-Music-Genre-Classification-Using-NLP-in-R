What sort of a situation would you like?\\nLet's suppose, I do this often in vocational guidance of students,\\nThey come to me and say, well,\\n\"We're getting out of college and we have the faintest idea what we want to do\".\\nSo I always ask the question,\\n\"What would you like to do if money were no object?\\nHow would you really enjoy spending your life?\"\\nWell, it's so amazing as a result of our kind of educational system,\\nCrowds of students say well, we'd like to be painters, we'd like to be poets,\\nWe'd like to be writers, but as everybody knows you can't earn any money that way.\\nOr another person says well, I'd like to live an out-of-doors life and ride horses.\\nI said you want to teach in a riding school? Let's go through with it.\\nWhat do you want to do?\\nWhen we finally got down to something, which the individual says he really wants to do,\\nI will say to him, you do that and forget the money,\\nBecause, if you say that getting the money is the most important thing,\\nYou will spend your life completely wasting your time.\\nYou'll be doing things you don't like doing in order to go on living,\\nThat is to go on doing things you don't like doing, which is stupid                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
